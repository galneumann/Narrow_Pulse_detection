## Random Pulse Spectrum Analyzer
Overview: This repository contains the code, documentation, and designs for a Random Pulse Spectrum Analyzer. The project is a cost-effective and portable alternative to high-end spectrum analyzers, specifically designed for real-time signal analysis. The system integrates hardware and software components to generate, capture, analyze, and display random pulse signals in the frequency domain.

Key Features:

Real-time signal processing and frequency domain analysis.
Uses Teensy 4.0 for signal generation.
AD9226 ADC module for high-speed sampling.
Raspberry Pi 4 Model B for signal processing and visualization.
MATLAB integration for high-quality plotting and analysis.
